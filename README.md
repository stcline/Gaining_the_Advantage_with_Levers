# :robot: Gaining the Advantage with Levers

## 🤓 Overview and learning outcomes 

Mechanical advantage may be attained by utilizing one of the oldest machines in human history, the lever.  For this assighment you and your partner will build several levers, calculate mechanical advantage for each one and then test your results.  Finally, you will consider real-world applications of these systems. 🚀

I need to build a structure out of 8020 channel that can be used to hold one scale up.  Then, they will attach their lever to that scale at the appropriate input point for the lever class and then attach a known weight at the output to see if their calculations are correct.
